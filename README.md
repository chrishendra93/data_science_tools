This is a repository for algorithms and modules that will be useful for data analysis
Non-conventional algorithms such as Tree Augmented Naive Bayes and other regularised version of Naive Bayes using discretization via histogram / kde will be included as part of this repository
This repo will also include several wrappers for sklearn k-fold cv modules and some features selection method using BIC or hill climber algorithm with custom metric and spark implementation
