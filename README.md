-	This is a repository for algorithms and modules that will be useful for data analysis
-	Non-conventional algorithms such as Tree Augmented Naive Bayes and other regularised version of Naive Bayes with discretization via histogram / kde will be included as part of this repository
-	This repo will also include several wrappers for sklearn k-fold cv modules and some features selection method using BIC or hill climber algorithm with custom metric and spark implementation
